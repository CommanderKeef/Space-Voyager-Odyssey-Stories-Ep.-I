Player: *You have encountered what appears to be a derelict military/scouting outpost, slowly submerging itself in the shifting sand dunes over time.*
Player: *There is no sign of life anywhere - it appears that the inhabitants of the outpost could not hold out against their attackers and met their demise in the sands.*
Player: This is getting interesting... Looks like the recon operation was a good call, i'll have to make sure command hears about what's going on down here!
